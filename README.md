- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsmoove20
I'm a prospective junior data analyst, with a strong passion for reach on positive engagement and intrinsic motivation. 
As a new grad from Keuka College, I'm also the inaugural recipient of the Trevor Irby '17 Leadership Award in 2020 (Highest Undergraduate Honor). 
Completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Spring of 2022. 

Driven by my interest in finding useful insights to tell data-driven stories, 
I conducted the Correlates of Self-Efficacy study in the Students in Transitions Lab at Keuka College. 
Using Tableau, I showed that those actively leading a social program, not only have significantly increased intrinsic motivation but are positively affected by the act of leading a social program.

In my pursuit of degrees and certifications, I've worked as a Life Insurance Broker and assisted high-level clients using top-tier data visualizations. 
In addition, I've assisted small businesses with loan inquiries and guided loan processing and term validation. 

I'm proficient with SQL and Tableau, with a sufficient understanding of statistical analysis, causal inference, relational databases, and social engagement. With all these numbers I do also enjoy genuine conversations about the latest tech, software, and R&D in the world of Data and Psychology!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL Queries and Understanding from the University of California, Davis' 'SQL For Data Science'.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and long-time hiring for the Insurance/Healthcare Industry.
